# In this project, I will use behaviour data from a multi-category eCommerce store taken from Kaggle, perform Exploratory Data Analysis to answer below business questions.


1) What is the daily traffic in Oct?
2) What product category and brands are more popular in viewing and purchasing?
3) Customer Purchase behaviour (such as number of customers just viewing products or number of customers adding products to their shopping cart and number of customer who actually buy the product)?
4) Amount spent by customers who purchased the products?
